        <p>The process of buying over-the-counter cold medication at a local pharmacy can be dizzying. How can there be five types of Sudafed, six types of Mucinex, and four kinds of DayQuil and NyQuil all in one shelf? Meanwhile, big, bold words like, “maximum strength” and “severe cold” only make your runny nose feel stuffier and unbearable. 
        <p> Yet, most of us use the pharmacy aisle as our first line of defense when the flu or a cold hits. According to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3461939/">2008 study </a> posted on the Federal Drug Association website, BeMedWise.org, 86 percent of 1,000 parents reported that they would use an over-the-counter (OTC) medication prior to or instead of consulting a pediatrician. </p> 

        <p>But how many of us actually read the drug labels on our medicine boxes? How do we know what really works?</p>
        <p>Turns out, most of us don’t have a clue. In 2006, a <a href="http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11623">report </a>from the <i> Institute of Medicine of the National Academies </i> said that medication errors are among the most common medical errors, harming at least 1.5 million people every year. </p>
        <p> The freedom that comes with self-medication comes with risks that most people aren’t aware of. Millions of us snap off the top of a medicine bottle or chug down a cocktail of cough syrups with the hopes that it will treat our pain. But every swallow and chew could do more harm than good. If you’re taking two types of medications with the same active ingredients, chances of overdose are high. This is called drug-drug interaction. It can alter the way one or both of the drugs act in the body and can cause unexpected and deathly side effects such as nausea, headache, heartburn, and dizziness.  </p>
        <p> In 2000, a <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/412269">survey of pediatricians </a>conducted at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), show that 61 percent of respondents are concerned that parents overdose their children by combining common OTC and cold medication. Even more, 73 percent of pediatricians worry that some parents are confused when selecting OTC medications.</p> 
        <p> That's a problem, because not all OTC cold and cough medications are created the same. Some have fever reducers; some only relieve nasal decongestion. That’s why it’s important to read the drug labels and use only <i>one</i> OTC cough and cold medicine unless your doctor says it’s okay to consume more. </p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/drugs/emergencypreparedness/bioterrorismanddrugpreparedness/ucm133411.htm">FDA requires </a>that all OTC drug product labeling contain the title, active ingredient(s), use(s), warning(s), inactive ingredients, purpose, directions, and other information. Sure, the drug labels contain all these details, but it can seem like a foreign language. It is also debatable whether consumers read and fully understand the drug label before buying products. In a <a href="http://www.bemedwise.org/survey/final_survey.pdf">2002 national survey</a> of consumers and health professionals by the National Council on Patient Information and Education, results found that seven in ten medical professionals – 69 percent - felt that a lack of knowledge about active ingredients contributed a great deal to inappropriate use. </p>
        <p>So, what does that mean for consumers? Develop the habit of reading the drug label, just like you would read the nutrition facts of your favorite cereal. In an effort to make them less daunting and more familiar, below is a database of common ingredients in OTC cold medications, as well as some information on folk remedies that help ease cold symptoms. This database is by no means exhaustive. However, it only includes products that have been scientifically supported to aid cold symptoms. </p>
